# Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler

>## Description

Created a simple calendar application that allows a user to save tasks for each hour of the workday (9am -5pm). Time slots in the past display as gray, the current hour time slot diplays red, and all future slots display a green appearance. This allows the user to know which times are available, as well as visualize which task deadlines are approaching and prioritize those tasks.

>## Features

*  Applied and showcased the core skills I've recently learned: Javascript fucntions, such as calls to jQuery, event listeners, if/else statements, for loops, traversing the DOM, data attributes, and accessing/saving to local storage.

* Followed best practices for class/id naming conventions, indentation, and quality comments.

* Included a preview of the webpage within this ReadME, which displays the tools we've learned thus far in the coding bootcamp.
